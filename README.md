## Project Overview

This project builds a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images and deploys the model into an app.
Given an image, the app will predict the most likely locations where the image was taken.

This project demonstrates the understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. 

Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.

## Project Instructions

#### Setting up locally

This setup requires a bit of familiarity with creating a working deep learning environment. While things should work out of the box, in case of problems you might have to do operations on your system (like installing new NVIDIA drivers) that are not covered in the class. Please do this if you are at least a bit familiar with these subjects, otherwise please consider using the provided Udacity workspace that you find in the classroom.

1. Open a terminal and clone the repository, then navigate to the downloaded folder:
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/cd1821-CNN-project-starter.git
		cd cd1821-CNN-project-starter
	```
    
2. Create a new conda environment with python 3.7.6:

    ```
        conda create --name udacity_cnn_project -y python=3.7.6
        conda activate udacity_cnn_project
    ```
    
    NOTE: you will have to execute `conda activate udacity_cnn_project` for every new terminal session.
    
3. Install the requirements of the project:

    ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install and open Jupyter lab:
	
	```
        pip install jupyterlab
		jupyter lab
	```

### Developing your project

Now that you have a working environment, execute the following steps:

>**Note:** Complete the following notebooks in order, do not move to the next step if you didn't complete the previous one.

1. Open the `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions there
2. Open `transfer_learning.ipynb` and follow the instructions
3. Open `app.ipynb` and follow the instructions there
